Adopting a dog creates a symbiotic relationship that benefits both the pet and the owner. Numerous studies highlight the social advantages of having a canine companion, including a significant reduction in feelings of loneliness. Furthermore, research indicates notable health benefits for dog owners, <a href="https://www.ahajournals.org/doi/10.1161/CIRCOUTCOMES.119.005554" target="_blank">such as lower blood pressure and improved lipid profiles</a>.<br><br>If you are a dog owner, it's crucial to ensure your pet's well-being by paying attention to their diet and providing ample opportunities for exercise. This page offers valuable insights and guidance on caring for your furry friends throughout the various stages of their lives.<br></p><a href="../" class="btn btn-d btn-lg">More Info</a></div></div></div></div><!-- bloc-6 END --><!-- bloc-7 --><div class="bloc l-bloc b-divider" id="bloc-7"><div class="container bloc-lg"><div class="row"><div class="col-md-4 col-lg-12"><h3 class="mg-md">Diet & Exercise</h3><p class="p-29264-style">As dogs age, their feeding schedules should gradually change. Puppies should be nursed for the first two months of life, after which they can be introduced to three meals per day from about three to six months old. Between six months and one year, their meals should be reduced to two per day, and once they reach one year, it’s appropriate to transition them to one meal a day. It's important to remember that a dog's body is composed of 60 to 70 percent water. According to the <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/dog-care/dog-nutrition-tips" target="_blank">ASPCA</a>, even a 10 percent reduction in body water can lead to illness, while a loss of 15 percent can be fatal. Therefore, ensuring your dog stays hydrated is crucial!<br><br>Like humans, dogs require regular exercise to maintain their overall health, including the well-being of their organs, along with access to fresh air and sunlight. Recommended exercise times can vary significantly based on breed and size, but generally, dogs should get between 30 to 120 minutes of exercise daily. While the idea of exercising for two hours may be daunting for some, others may find it perfectly manageable! Remember, taking your dog for brisk walks counts as exercise too, so don’t feel pressured to engage in intense workouts. You can also encourage physical activity with a variety of toys; just make sure they are age-appropriate and do not pose choking hazards. Always supervise your dog with toys that require extra attention to ensure their safety.<br></p></div><div class="col-md-4 col-lg-12"><h3 class="mg-md">Grooming & Handling</h3><p class="p-5-style">Maintaining your furry family member's cleanliness is essential for their health and well-being. Regular brushing helps minimize shedding and prevents matting and tangling of fur, which can be challenging to untangle. After outings in heavily wooded areas, be sure to check for pests like ticks and fleas.<br><br>Bathing your dog is not only vital for hygiene but can also be a workout, depending on your dog’s temperament. Make sure to thoroughly rinse out all soap, as any residue can lead to skin irritations or rashes. Always choose a shampoo specifically formulated for dogs, as harsh soaps can trigger allergic reactions.<br><br>When handling your beloved pet, safety is key, regardless of their size. For small dogs, gently cradle them with one hand supporting their chest and your forearm supporting their hindquarters. For larger breeds, reach under their belly with both arms, positioning them perpendicularly to provide support for both the chest and hind legs as you lift. Your careful approach will ensure a comfortable and secure handling experience for your canine companion.<br></p></div><div class="col-md-4 offset-lg-0 col-lg-12"><h3 class="mg-md">Vaccinations & Medications</h3><p>It's essential to consult your veterinarian regarding vaccination for your dog, but there is a standard set of vaccines that are generally recommended. These vaccines help reduce the risk of exposure to serious illnesses such as hepatitis, rabies, and parvovirus. Your veterinarian may also suggest additional vaccines based on your dog's specific environment and lifestyle. These may include vaccinations for <a href="https://www.aspca.org/pet-care/general-pet-care/vaccinations-your-pet" target="_blank">Bordetella bronchiseptica, Borrelia burgdorferi, and Leptospira bacteria</a><br></p></div></div></div></div><!-- bloc-7 END --><!-- ScrollToTop Button --><button aria-label="Scroll to top button" class="bloc-button btn btn-d scrollToTop" onclick="scrollToTarget('1',this)"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="22" height="22" viewBox="0 0 32 32"><path class="scroll-to-top-btn-icon" d="M30,22.656l-14-13-14,13"/></svg></button><!-- ScrollToTop Button END--><!-- bloc-6 --><div class="bloc bg-Stock-20Image-20DCDEEF1A-FBD0-4254-A14E-FB1F2009075E-jpeg l-bloc bloc-bg-texture texture-geometry-shapes bg-l-edge" id="bloc-6"><div class="container bloc-lg bloc-lg-lg"><div class="row row-7-style g-0"><div class="col-md-3 col-sm-6 order-lg-0 align-self-center text-lg-center col-lg-4 offset-lg-9"><div class="container-div-style"><picture><source type="image/webp" srcset="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-srcset="../img/Logo%202.webp"><img src="../img/lazyload-ph.png" data-src="../img/Logo%202.png" class="img-fluid mx-auto d-block img-protected img-frame-lg lazyload" alt="Logo%202" width="287" height="123"></picture></div><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link link-style text-lg-center">Privacy</a><a href="../" class="a-btn a-block footer-link text-lg-center">Terms of use</a></div></div></div></div><!-- bloc-6 END --></div><!-- Main container END -->  <!-- Additional JS --><script src="../js/all.js?548"></script><!-- Additional JS END --></body></html>
