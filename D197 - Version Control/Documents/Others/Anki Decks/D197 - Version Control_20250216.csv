"1","What does git init do?","Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.","git init","","Initialization","This command sets up a new local repository. It creates a hidden subdirectory named .git that contains all necessary Git files.","Always initialize a repository when starting a new project to begin version control.","Remember, git init is used once per project.","1"
"2","How do you add files to the staging area?","Use git add <file> for individual files or git add . for all files in the working directory.","git add <file>","","Staging Area","This command stages changes in the specified file(s) so they will be included in the next commit. Wildcards can be used to add patterns matching files.","Use git add before each commit to ensure only intended changes are committed.","Remember, you need to stage your changes with git add before committing them.","2"
"3","How do you commit staged changes?","Use git commit -m ""Your commit message"" to save the staged changes with a descriptive message.","git commit -m ""Initial commit""","","Commit","This command captures a snapshot of the project's current state of the staged changes, along with a log message from the user describing the changes.","Use meaningful and detailed commit messages that describe what was changed.","Always include a clear and concise commit message.","3"
"4","What is the purpose of the git branch command?","The git branch command allows you to create, list, rename, and delete branches.","git branch <branch-name>","","Branching","This command creates a new branch. By default, it starts from the current HEAD, but can be specified otherwise.","Use branching to manage different features or fixes without affecting the main codebase.","Branches help you work on multiple features simultaneously without interfering with each other.","4"
"5","How do you switch between branches?","You can either use git checkout <branch-name> or git checkout -b <new-branch-name> to switch branches.","git checkout <branch-name> or git checkout -b <new-branch-name>","","Branch Switching","This command checks out the specified branch, updating the working directory and index to match that branch.","Always ensure you are on the correct branch before making changes.","Switching branches requires being in a repository with multiple branches.","5"
"6","What does git merge do?","The git merge command is used to join two or more development histories together. It integrates the specified branch's history into the current branch.","git merge <branch-name>","","Merging","This command merges the changes from one branch into another, usually the current branch.","Use git merge carefully, especially when there are many conflicts to avoid overwriting important changes.","Conflicts can arise during merging; resolve them before finalizing the merge.","6"
"7","How do you push local commits to a remote repository?","Use git push origin <branch-name> to send your committed changes to the remote server associated with the origin.","git push origin <branch-name>","","Remote Repositories","This command uploads local branch commits to a remote repository. It requires an authenticated Git server connection.","Ensure you have proper authentication for remote pushes and pulls.","Authentication is crucial for secure access to remote repositories.","7"
"8","What does git clone do?","The git clone command copies an existing repository from a remote server to your local machine. It includes all the version history, branches, and commits.","git clone <repository-url>","","Cloning Repositories","This command creates a new directory named after the repository and pulls down a copy of all data for that repository.","Use git clone to start working with an existing project from scratch.","Clone is particularly useful for collaborating on projects remotely.","8"
"9","How do you pull changes from a remote repository?","Use git pull origin <branch-name> to fetch and merge the latest commits from the specified branch.","git pull origin <branch-name>","","Pulling Changes","This command updates your local repository with the most recent versions pushed by others.","Regularly pull changes to stay up-to-date with team members.","Keeping your local repository in sync is crucial for smooth collaboration.","9"
